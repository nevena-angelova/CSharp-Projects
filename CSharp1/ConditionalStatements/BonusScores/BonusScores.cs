// Write a program that applies bonus scores to given scores in the range [1..9]. The program reads a digit as an input.
// If the digit is between 1 and 3, the program multiplies it by 10; if it is between 4 and 6, multiplies it by 100; if it is between 7 and 9, multiplies it by 1000.
// If it is zero or if the value is not a digit, the program must report an error.
// Use a switch statement and at the end print the calculated new value in the console.
